        You can call all the methods from FileEngine class which contains all the backend
        functionalities. As it was mentioned that the code will be unit tested that;s why 
        function call is not implemented here.
        
        But still you can runn this code and see that the json file with blank Key-Value will be created.
        
        Thank You !
